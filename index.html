            <h2>What is Generative AI?</h2>
            
            <p>Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can create new content -- like text, images,audio,or even code -- based on patterns they've learned from vast amounts of data.</p>
            <div>
                <p>Unlike traditional AI, which is often used for tasks like classification or prediction, generative AI goes a step further by producing original outputs that mimic human creativity.</p>
                
                <p>Generative AI has been making waves across various industries, from entertainment to healthcare, and is reshaping how we interact with technology.</p>
                <p> AI can be used to <span class="clickableText"> generate realistic images</span>, <span class="clickableText"> mimic human speech</span>, <span class="clickableText"> or write emails</span>, among other applications. </p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div>
                <p>But with great power comes great responsibility—and risk.</p> 
                <p>Unfortunately, generative AI can also be used by cybercriminals to craft more convincing and scalable attacks.</p>
            </div>

        </div>
    </section>


    <section class="content-section" data-scene="scene2">
        <div class="content sticky-right">
            <div>
                <h2>Phishing Emails</h2>
                <p>Traditionally, phishing emails were easy to spot—poor grammar, generic greetings, and suspicious links. But now, generative AI can write highly personalized, grammatically perfect messages that mimic real colleagues or companies.</p>
                <p>These emails might:</p>>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reference your recent projects</li>
                    <li>Use your company's branding</li>
                    <li>Include realistic-looking attachments or links</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Deepfake Audio & Video</h2>
                <p>AI can also generate fake audio or video clips that sound or look like real people. Imagine receiving a voicemail from your manager asking for sensitive data—except it's not really them.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Social Engineering at Scale</h2>
                <p>Generative AI can automate social engineering attacks, creating fake profiles, chatbots, or even entire websites that trick users into revealing personal or company information.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>What You Should Look Out For</h2>
            <p>So, how can you protect yourself?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Verify requests: Always double-check unexpected messages, especially those asking for sensitive info or urgent action.</li>
                <li>Check the sender: Look closely at email addresses and URLs. Even small differences can signal a fake.</li>
                <li>Report suspicious activity: If something feels off, trust your instincts and report it to your IT or security team.</li>
                <li>Stay informed: Cyber threats evolve quickly. Regular training and awareness are your best defense.</li>
            </ul>
