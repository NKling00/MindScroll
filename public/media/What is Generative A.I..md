**What is Generative A.I.?**

===

**New Possibilities:**



Generative A.I. refers to artificial intelligence systems that are able to generate new content.



Users are able to simply type in requests to the A.I. and the A.I will produce the results as best it can.



Generative AI can be used to generate realistic images:

&nbsp;	"Generate a picture of a dog on a skateboard"  >computer spits out flat image into space

it can create audio and voice recordings :

&nbsp;	"Create a voice that says "hey, this ai stuff is neat!" > Computer spits out floating/rotating music note, plays audio

it can even help you write documents or emails:

&nbsp;	"write me an email to my coworker telling them I will be late for lunch today"> Computer spits out email popup that fills in with 	fake text (or maybe real?)



Unlike traditional AI, which is often used for tasks like classification or prediction, generative AI goes a step further by producing original outputs that mimic human creativity.







#### But with great power comes great responsibilityâ€”and risk.

Unfortunately, generative AI can also be used by cybercriminals to craft more convincing and scalable attacks.













Needed Assets:

3 ai image examples

3 audio recording examples + 3 3d music notes

1 email popup



To DO:

Figure out what the shift is going to look like.
